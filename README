sinit - suckless init - nshp's fork
===================================

sinit is a simple init.  It was initially based on
Rich Felker's minimal init[1].

What's different?
----------------
My fork of sinit adds:

* Service forking defined in config.h with very dumb dependency tracking
* A single user session defined in config.h
* Base system mounting defined in config.h
* Static reboot and poweroff binaries which just send the signals listed below

Why?
----

I wanted a fast, completely static init for my laptop.

How?
----

There are 3 signals that sinit will act on.

      SIGUSR1: powers off the machine.
      SIGINT:  reboots the machine (or alternatively via ctrl-alt-del).
      SIGCHLD: reap children
